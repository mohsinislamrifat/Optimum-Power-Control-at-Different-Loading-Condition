# Optimum-Power-Control-at-Different-Loading-Condition
We consider three different loading condition such as base load, peak-load and off-peak load. Here we kept voltage constant and given different time delay considering voltage spike, surge voltage for three loading condition. We use current injection device to give the rated power to the load.
